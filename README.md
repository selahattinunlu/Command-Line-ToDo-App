# Command-Line-ToDo-App
Exercise - ToDo application running on the command line.

If you want to run it:

- Download
- UnZip
- cd {directory}
- `composer install`
- ./todo show (Show All Tasks)
- ./todo add `:description` (Add a task)
- ./todo remove `:id` (Remove task by id)

PS: I didn't want to publish this application as a composer package. Because, i did only exercise.
